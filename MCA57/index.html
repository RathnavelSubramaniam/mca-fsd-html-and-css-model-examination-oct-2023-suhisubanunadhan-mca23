            <p>Libraries are just places to store books and take Instagram photos. They are hubs of knowledge, activity and technology that can be ambitious in scale and design. To create appropriate, safe and comfortable areas for study, reading, research and even socializing,<br>
                <br>
                 we need to know the principles of modern library design. This is also helpful for creating the best construction drawings for building a library.
<br>
<br>
                Current expectations for libraries are high. Indeed, library building projects are especially complex in terms of purpose, audience, and equipment. Designers, architects and engineers are working to create striking exteriors and interiors to attract a wide variety of people.<br>
                </p>
<p>
    The modern library experience refers to the ways in which libraries have adapted and evolved to meet the changing needs and expectations of patrons in the digital age. This includes providing access to a wide range of digital and physical resources, such as e-books, databases, and online learning resources, 
    <br>as well as offering new and innovative services such as maker spaces, digital literacy training, and technology lending programs.
